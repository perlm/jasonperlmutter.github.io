<p>I'm currently a Data Scientist at <a href=https://www.google.com/>Google</a>. Prior to that I've worked as a Data Scientist at NYC Department of Finance, and before that with Hillary for America.</p>

<p>When I was starting out in data science I published hobby projects on <a href=https://hastydata.wordpress.com/>a weblog</a> and my <a href=https://twitter.com/Hasty_Data>twitter page</a>. I worked on when I was starting out in the field. For example, on my twttier page I would serve daily predictions for NBA game and <a href=https://hastydata.wordpress.com/2016/11/26/modeling-jeopardy-revisited/>Jeopardy win probabilities</a>.</p>

<p>Below is a "word cloud" from <a href=https://hastydata.wordpress.com/2020/11/08/talk-the-walky-talky/>an analysis</a> of twitter data regressed against election outcomes, which wasn't particularly useful but does make for a nice image.</p>
