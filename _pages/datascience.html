I'm currently a professional Data Scientist. <a href=https://hastydata.wordpress.com/>Here's a weblog</a> I worked on when I was starting out in the field.<br><br>

An example hobby project - a "word cloud" from <a href=https://hastydata.wordpress.com/2020/11/08/talk-the-walky-talky/>an analysis</a> of twitter data regressed against election outcomes. It wasn't very useful, but it makes for a nice image.
